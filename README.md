This project utilizes Framer Motion to create smooth and engaging animations. For example, in the Home.jsx component, we have:

jsx
Copy code
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const Home = () => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 1 }}
  >
    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  </motion.div>
);
